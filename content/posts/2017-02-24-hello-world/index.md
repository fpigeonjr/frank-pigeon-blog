## My First Post

As a web developer when you are learning a new language the first thing we learn to do is output the string `hello world`.

In 2017 one of my goals was to write more. I have found a tool will allow me to get my thoughts down quickly in [markdown] and publish live with one command from terminal.

```js

yarn run deploy

```

## Gatsby

This tool is called [Gatsby][gatsby].

Gatsby allows you to transform plain text into dynamic blogs and websites using the latest web technologies. A [React.js][react] static site generator.

So the exciting thing for me is that I've also been wanting to learn Javascript deeper so I've settled with learning React as a way to reach my goal.

## Blog Redesign

So after going through the [React Essentials][react-essentials] Lynda course (which is excellent by the way) I decided to continue to explore using React by redesigning my blog using Gatsby.

So here we are. Hope you like it.

## Future Content

I love learning and will continue to share what I learn along the way and continue contributing to open source.

I hope you find it helpful to read as it is for me to write my thoughts down.
