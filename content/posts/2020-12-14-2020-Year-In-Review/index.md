## 2020: One of the Toughest Years

2020 has been a one of the toughest years that I can recall. The COVID19 pandemic has hit us collectively and devoured nine months of the year and all the holidays and celebrations along the way.

I am not sure what God is trying to tell us, but He has gotten our attention nonetheless. 

I still have a lot to be grateful for.  While many have caught the virus, we have been healthy. While many have lost their jobs and income, we have still have meaningful, engaging work. While many have been overwhelmed and stressed, we have found peace.

## Favorite things from 2020

### 1. Rest

This year has taught me to slow down and walk more with God. We have distracted ourselves with so much busyness that we no longer can hear God's voice or feel his presence.

I am excited to learn more about the Sabbath and learn how to trust in Him and receive the gift of rest. Without distractions and hurry, maybe I can focus more on my family and relationship with Jesus.

### 2. Remote Work

I have always dreamed of having a remote job. And lo and behold, the pandemic came and we were told that we were instructed to Work From Home(WFH) and it was a dream come true.

I find that my team has become closer and worked more productively in the new era of WFH. We meet when we need to and don't have to wait until we are all in the office. 

There is no commute and less distractions in my environment so I can focus on work and get more done. 

One problem is that the kitchen is so close and accessible that its been all too easy to grab a snack and I have noticed that some weight gain during this quarantine.

I don't know if I can ever go back to a office job, life is too short to live inside a cubicle.

### 3. Books

I have regained a new level of joy from reading and listening to audio books. I enjoy both methods, but listening is more flexible but I find that I retain more if its read. Also being able to highlight and recall my highlights is a killer feature on my Kindle. 

I have even tried to read some technical books and enjoyed a new learning method. Best part is that the book is a physical thing, and you never lost track of where you are. It will be right there where you left off tomorrow.

### 4. Family Time

One of my favorite pastimes has been watching home movies of when the boys where little. They are growing up so fast and I feel like I will blink and they will be off to college. 

It's been fun to play board games together, make pancakes on Saturday morning, listen to all their stories, and hum along as they practice piano. They are so smart and I am so proud of them. 

Also spending time with my wife has been wonderful and something I look forward to all week. I remember early in the quarantine when she was working from, we would walk early in the mornings before the boys would get up. We would joke that this is a glimpse of retirement and I am happy to have someone as beautiful as her to grow old with. 

### 5. Self Development
