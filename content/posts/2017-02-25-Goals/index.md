## Everyone has goals

As we started a new year, it seems like everyone was talking about setting new years' resolutions. A few months into the year many lose focus on what they wanted to achieve.

So I am going to write them down here on my blog so I can stay commited to them and look back **in case I get lost along the way**.

### Spiritual

Start with putting God first. I want to attend church weekly and attend a bible study.

> Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need. <br/> > **Matthew 6:33**

### Family

A family outing and one date night a month. Good thing we have **grandparents** nearby!

### Physical

Attend the local bootcamp at least twice a week.

### Professional

- Learn ~~React~~ Vue and full stack Javascript
- Learn to deploy apps on Dokku

```js
// TODO: code every day
```
