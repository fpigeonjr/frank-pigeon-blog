Vue is an amazing javascript framework to work in but how do you get started...especially coming from React?

## Intro

At work I have been assigned on a Vue project and coming from React there was a lot to learn. This is my attempt to capture my thoughts and notes on what you will need to be a productive Vue developer.

## Evan You's talk The New Vue

Watching Evan's keynote will bring you up to speed on where the Vue Ecosystem is at...but it's pretty long so I will give you my takeaways.

- Vue3 will use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) by default
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a build tool and dev server (and way faster than Webpack and is framework agnostic)
- [`npm init vue`](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue) is the new way to create Vue apps
- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) is the new recommended vscode extension for Vue3 and provides 1st class Typescript Support
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) is the new global state management library aka vue store
- [Vue DevTools 6.0](https://devtools.vuejs.org/) extension for browser
- [script setup default in docs for composition api](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-setup.html#basic-usage) and will increase developer experience
- new docs site build with [vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/)

## Learning Vue

Now that you have a lay of the land in Vue time to get some training.

These are some courses I have enjoyed:

## Outro

It's been a great experience learning a new javascript framework like Vue. It has a great ecosystem, team, and community. The developer experience is really good and I hope to continue learning and using Vue on personal and work projects.
