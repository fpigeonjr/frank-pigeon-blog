This week I was thinking that it would be fun to have a place to share my book reviews for the books I have completed this year. But here's the catch: _there will be a limitation of three sentences_.

## Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World

by Cal Newport

I have been a fan of Cal Newport's work since I read **Deep Work** last year. Cal goes deeper into how to live a simpler, more meaningful life and not letting technology control us. This was a tough one for me to implement since it meant I had to cut my addiction to tech and just look up to really experience life.
