This week I was thinking that it would be fun to have a place to share my book reviews for the books I have completed this year. But here's the catch: _there will be a limitation of three sentences_.

## Books I Have Read In 2020

### The Road Back to You: An Enneagram Journey to Self-Discovery

![The Road Back to You](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1466942357l/30753888._SY475_.jpg)

As a fan of the Myers Briggs personality test, this book exposes the reader to the ancient personality test known as the Enneagram which encompasses the Nine personality types. I have learned that I am a Number 4 (Romantic) and have learned some strategies on how to work on my weaknesses and understand my motivations and fears. It was fun to learn about the other personality types from the Enneagram and understand what drives them and best approaches to engage them.

As one of my favorite philosophers and intellectuals of 2019, I am drawn to Jordan's podcast and Youtube videos. You will learn how to live a life worth living, the rules which to play the game by. You will not want to miss this one.

A neurosurgeon with a brilliant future finds out he has terminal cancer in his thirties. In this unfinished memoir, he must find out what is truly important in life while facing death. This book is gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and teaches us about how to live.

## Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World

![Digital Minimalism book cover](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1549433350l/40672036._SY475_.jpg)

I have been a fan of Cal Newport's work since I read **Deep Work** last year. Cal goes deeper into how to live a simpler, more meaningful life and not letting technology control us. This was a tough one for me to implement since it meant I had to cut my addiction to tech and just look up to really experience life.
