This week I was thinking that it would be fun to have a place to share my book reviews for the books I have completed this year. But here's the catch: _there will be a limitation of three sentences_.

## Books I Have Read In 2020

### Range

![Range Life cover](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550048292l/41795733.jpg)

Epstein challenges the 10k hours of early specialization is the best path to success theory by showing us examples of late bloomers and people that's careers and interest change over time. That is good news for me as someone who changed specializations many times in my IT career and the research shows that people with range are better equipped for wicked environments. Foxes are better than hedge hodges.

### An Unhurried Life: Following Jesus' Rhythms of Work and Rest

![An Unhurried Life cover](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355941472l/16211574.jpg)

This was a such a challenging book for me as someone who races though life trying to get things done at a life's crazy pace. But if we follow Jesus's example we learn to walk with Him and experience life at 3 miles an hour. We can miss God's voice and opportunities to serve others when we rush through life.

### The Four-Hour Work Week

![four hour work week cover](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503703565l/8205855._SY475_.jpg)

Ferriss presents an exciting and different world view and provides tactical tips to stop running the 9-5 rat race and pursue what really matters. The new rich take mini-retirements while they are young and not wait until later in life to enjoy true freedom. Probably not applicable for everyone, but I found it enjoyable, fun, and mind-expanding to think about living life to its fullest and enjoying the little time we have in this life.

### Finish: Give Yourself the Gift of Done

![finish cover](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1497062318l/35397160._SY475_.jpg)

Acuff is a hilarious writer and had me cracking up many times when reading this book. The central theme is how to stop perfectionism from derailing your plan to get your goal finished. Developing tolerance for imperfection is the key factor in turning chronic starters into consistent finishers.

### Mindset: The New Psychology Of Success

![mindset cover](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1504769765l/5494321._SY475_.jpg)

Dweck will convince you to change your fixed mindset to a growth mindset and it will change your outlook on life in an incredible way. Failure doesn’t define you, it’s a problem to be faced, dealt with, and learned from. You will learn from examples in sports, business, education, and from her experience at Colombia on how the growth mindset can change how you deal with everyday challenges in a positive and life changing way.

### Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less

![Essentialism cover](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387736173l/19776547.jpg)

McKeown will guide you in the ways to live the life of one known as an Essentialist. It reminds us that only a few things matter and to focus our limited energy on those things that bring the highest contribution. "Less but Better" will be your new anthem in a world that keeps telling us that we can do it all.

### The Road Back to You: An Enneagram Journey to Self-Discovery

![The Road Back to You](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1466942357l/30753888._SY475_.jpg)

As a fan of the Myers Briggs personality test, this book exposes the reader to the ancient personality test known as the Enneagram which encompasses the Nine personality types. I have learned that I am a Number 4 (Romantic) and have learned some strategies on how to work on my weaknesses and understand my motivations and fears. It was fun to learn about the other personality types from the Enneagram and understand what drives them and best approaches to engage them.

### 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos

![12 Rules For Life](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1509468449l/33792742._SY475_.jpg)

As one of my favorite philosophers and intellectuals of 2019, I am drawn to Jordan's podcast and Youtube videos. You will learn how to live a life worth living, the rules which to play the game by. You will not want to miss this one.

A neurosurgeon with a brilliant future finds out he has terminal cancer in his thirties. In this unfinished memoir, he must find out what is truly important in life while facing death. This book is gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and teaches us about how to live.

## Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World

![Digital Minimalism book cover](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1549433350l/40672036._SY475_.jpg)

I have been a fan of Cal Newport's work since I read **Deep Work** last year. Cal goes deeper into how to live a simpler, more meaningful life and not letting technology control us. This was a tough one for me to implement since it meant I had to cut my addiction to tech and just look up to really experience life.
