2021 was a good year despite having caught the covid bug and being sick for many weeks.

Hard to believe how lucky I am and how God has blessed me and my family.

## Reflections on 2021

Here are some of my favorites moments from 2021.

### 💼 Started a new job

I joined the Flexion team. I started interviewing with them in October and the interview process was a great experience. My recruiter was awesome and coached me through the entire process.

This is my second break in service from the Department of Army and it was everything I wanted:

- agile mindset
- core values align with mine
- challenging and engaging work
- remote-always
- life work balance

I know I will be learning a lot and growing in my craft.

### 🚗 California trip

In December we visited my sister-in-law in California and we had a great family trip. Some of the highlights include:

- Casita in the Desert Springs
- Universal Studios
- See the extended Portillo family
- Fried turkey

### 🎣 Canyon Lake

We stayed at Canyon Lake in the Spring and it was so relaxing being there.

Canyon Lake is a remote beautiful camp ground near the lake and is great place to get away from the city and enjoy some fresh air and spend time in the great outdoors. Hope to go back again soon.

### 🐶 Oreo

My youngest son Carlos has always wanted a dog. So we finally got him one and she was a happy, loving, energetic puppy. We named her Oreo.

Unfortunately, my wife's allergies to pets forced us to find her a new home.

Thanks for the happy memories Oreo.

### 🎸 Jamming as a family

<!-- TODO: Add an image -->

It's no surprise that my family is very musical. It runs in their blood. Both my boys have been taking piano lessons from their grandma since they were very little and it has set a great musical foundation.

Caleb has started taking drum lessons and is playing in the school band.

Carlos is learning violin and playing guitar.

So we have had an opportunity to jam as a family and every time we do it its so much fun.

This is a dream come true for me. Glad that I can pass down my love of music to the next generation. #proudpapa

### ⚽ Concacaf Gold Cup Group D Doubleheader Qatar v Panama and Honduras vs Grenada

We went as a family to see the 🇵🇦 Panama national team play in Houston. We made a family trip to see them and had a blast. They lost unfortunately but its always fun to be at the match.

### ⚽ Soccer Tournament in Beaumont Texas

My son's soccer coach was great this season and they the team went all the way to the finals. It was held in Beaumont, Texas and we travelled there as a family and stayed for the weekend.

> 🐊 No we didn't eat any alligator burgers.

### 🤩 Chris Tomlin concert

We went to see Chris Tomlin in Austin in the Spring. This was our first big outing since covid so it was fun to get out of the house and go to see live music.

### 🌞 South Padre visit

<!-- TODO: Add an image -->

In the summer, we stayed a few days at South Padre. The **Spasmatics**, a local San Antonio band, were playing the first night we stayed and they sounded great.

We enjoyed the sun, the beach, and exploring the island. Hope we can make it back again this summer and not see any jellyfish.

### 🥶 Snowpocalypse

<!-- TODO: Add an image -->

In February we had the worst snow storm that I had ever experienced in Texas.

It got in the teens for an entire week and brought snow like Texas had never seen. It took a toll on the power grid and many lost power, heat, and water. There were stories of people warming up in their cars or warming stations in the city.

We live near a fire station so we didn't loose power. We were one of the lucky ones. We did loose water for a few days but the community pool allowed people to collect buckets of water so we did that and were able to at least flush our toilets.

It was not a fun week but we survived.

## 🎉 Looking Forward To 2022

2021 was a good year for me and my family and I know God even has more blessings in store for us in 2022.

> 🥳 More than anything we could ever imagine.
