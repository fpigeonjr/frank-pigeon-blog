2021 was a good year despite having caught the covid bug and being sick for many weeks.

Hard to believe how lucky I am and how God has blessed me and my family.

## Reflections on 2021

Now that I've written these down it looks like it was a pretty wild year. Here are some of my favorites moments from 2021.

### Started a new job

I started a new position with Flexion. I started interviewing with them in October and the interview process was a great experience. My recruiter was their coaching me the whole way through the entire process.

This is my second break in service from the Department of Army and it was everything I wanted:

- remote-always
- flexible hours
- agile mindset
- core values align with mine
- challenging and engaging work
- good pay

### California trip

In December we visited my sister-in-law in California and we had a great family trip. Some of the highlights include:

- Casita in the desert
- Universal Studios

### Canyon Lake

We stayed at Canyon Lake in the Spring and it was so relaxing being there.

Canyon Lake is a remote buetoful camp ground near the lake and is great place to get away and enjoy some fresh air and spend time in the outdoors. Hope to go back again soon.

### Oreo

My youngest son Carlos has always wanted a dog. So we finally got him one and she was a happy, loving, energetic puppy.

Unfortunately, my wife's allergies to pets forced us to find her a new home.

Thanks for the happy memories Oreo.

### Jamming as a family

So it's no surprise that my family is very musical. It runs in their blood. Both my boys have been taking piano lessons from their grandma since they were very little and it set a great foundation.

Caleb has started taking drum lessons and is playing in the school band.

Carlos is learning voilin and playing guitar.

So we have had an opportunity to jam as a family and everytime we do it its like nothing else.

This is a dream come true for me. #proudpapa
