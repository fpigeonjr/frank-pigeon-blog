## Code Editor + Terminal   

![moonlight](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atomiks/moonlight-vscode-theme/master/preview.png)

I have been using [Visual Studio Code][visual studio code] as my code editor for over a four years now. I recently switched to the insiders build since it always has some newer features like **settings sync** and **github integrations**. 

> ❤️ Probably my favorite electron app by far. 

My favorite color themes are [Moonlight](https://github.com/atomiks/moonlight-vscode-theme), [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme), and [1984](https://github.com/juanmnl/vs-1984). 

My favorite fonts is [hasklig](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig) and the still in beta [recursive](https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive) variable font.

For my terminal, I have stuck with [iTerm2][iterm2] when on mac. It is reliable, customizable, and just works. I go fullscreen with a slight transparency. I also use [oh-my-zshell][oh-my-zsh], [pure-prompt][pure], with the [facebook theme][facebook-iterm]. 

On Linux, I am using [Yakuake](https://kde.org/applications/system/org.kde.yakuake) which is the default drop down terminal in KDE.

## Hardware

### Desktop

**2014 Custom Build**

- NZXT Tempest 210 case
- GIGABYTE GA-Z87X-D3H motherboard
- Intel Core i5-4670K Haswell 3.4GHz
- Intel HD Graphics 4600 1536 MB
- Sapphire Radeon RX580
- 16GB 1600mhz DDR3 memory
- Corsair CX500 Power Supply
- (2)256 SSD and 1TB HD

### Laptop

Bought my first macintosh due to it being a requirement for my [coding bootcamp][codeup]. It is a [2012 15" retina macbook pro][mac] sitting ontop of a [Rain Laptop Stand][rain-stand]. I have not used it very much since I am on my Hackintosh most if the time.

### Monitor

I am now on #teamcrispy with my LG 27UK850-W 27" 4K UHD IPS Monitor. 4K is a dream and text and images look really sharp.

 Inspiration for the setup is from [A Single Monitor Manifesto][manifesto] by [Cory House][cory-house]. It made a lot sense to me and am happy with the new setup. This new setup helps me stay focused on the task at hand and avoid distractions.
