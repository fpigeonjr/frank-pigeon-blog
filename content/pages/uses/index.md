## Editor + Terminal

![vscode](./vscode.png)

I have been using [Visual Studio Code][visual studio code] as my code editor for over a two years now and have been very happy with it. Probably my favorite electron app by far. My favorite color themes are [Cobalt2][cobalt2], [Dracula][dracula], [Material Facebook][material facebook]. My favorite font is [Dank Mono][dank mono].

![iterm](./iterm.png)

For my terminal, I have stuck with [iTerm2][iterm2]. It is reliable, customizable, and just works. I go fullscreen with a slight transparency. I also use [oh-my-zshell][oh-my-zsh], [pure-prompt][pure], with the [facebook theme][facebook-iterm]. I played around with Hyper but had some issues so I switched back.

## Hardware

![setup](./setup.jpg)

Bought my first macintosh due to it being a requirement for my [coding bootcamp][codeup]. It is a [2012 15" retina macbook pro][mac] sitting ontop of a [Rain Laptop Stand][rain-stand]. This has been my workhorse ever since I started coding and really enjoy working on mac. It is the closest we can get to linux but still having access to apps like Adobe's Creative Cloud.

I recently sold my dual monitor setup and replaced it with a single [Dell UltraSharp U2515H 25-Inch Monitor][dell-monitor] after reading [A Single Monitor Manifesto][manifesto] by [Cory House][cory-house]. It made a lot sense to me and am happy with the new setup. This new setup helps me stay focused on the task at hand and avoid distractions.

I own a [Logitech HD Laptop Webcam C615][webcam] for webchats and music recordings.

## Other

I use [Google Keep][keep] for my daily todos and started journaling in a private repo in Github.

I use [Trello][trello] for project management tasks for any given project.

My team uses [Slack][slack] for office communications. The goal being that email is for external customers.

I use [OpenDNS][opendns] to filter content and improve network speeds.

I built a [Raspberry Pi][rpi] using [pi-hole][pihole] to filter ads and have also setup [openvpn][openvpn] to secure traffic when I'm out in the wild.

I also setup a [Disney's Circle][circle] which is an amazing device that helps keep time limits on our children's internet time.
